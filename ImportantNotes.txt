Most people have had to endure long lectures either in a classroom or the workplace. But the human brain and body arenâ€™t hardwired to sit and pay attention for long periods of time.[1] In addition, you may have factors such as illness, insomnia, or even just a boring lecturer that make it difficult to get through lectures. But by mentally and physically preparing before the lecture and then engaging in the lecture in different ways, such as stretching your legs every few minutes, you can successfully get through long lectures.
